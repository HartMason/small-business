We hand-slice our provolone cheese and meats in-house every day, because packaged pre-sliced meats doesn't have the same ring to it. And we bake bread all day, every day because stale bread isn't bread, it's... croutons. The flavors of fresh-veggies, combined with hand-sliced meats and fresh-baked bread is what makes a Jimmy John's sandwich The Sandwich of Sandwiches."

         "description2": "Cabo Bob is really the combination of the spirit of many characters Ihave met through my years of traveling and living in Baja California.The first encounter with a true Cabo Bob character was when my friendsand I were camped out at a Southern Baja surf spot known as“Shipwrecks,” in the 80s. We were staring at our second day ofrelatively flat ocean when we saw this beat up old VW Combi Van pull offthe dirt road onto the beach. An old beach bum rolled out and saw wewere getting ready to leave the infamous surf spot and he told us tohang out a bit longer. We rolled our eyes at this old surfer with hisvan packed full of junk, wondering if this guy even had the slightestclue what he was talking about. We let out a collective “yah right” andkept packing up our stuff. Within the hour we could hear the poundingsurf on the beach as the waves grew larger… Turns out we had severaldays of great waves and great stories from the old Baja vagabond. To myfriends and me, Cabo Bob became the general term for that person whojust has life and his surroundings figured out, he never stresses, hejust moves on down the road to a better spot. After all, he knows whereall the best places are! This restaurant was created to honor the spiritof Cabo Bob. We all know someone like him. Knowing that most of us cantlive like Cabo Bob, we hope you come to think of this as a great spotwhere you can come in and get the best Burritos and Fish Tacos in astress-free environment—except for the cooks, we like to keep them busy."
